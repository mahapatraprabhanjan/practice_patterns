GENERIC REPO is a sample console application project that implements the generic repository patterns and using autofac DI container to register the services.
It uses docker containers to up the SQL Server. And has one domain entity called User. We will be extending it further for other tables and check how the generic repo is working with other tables.

It uses entity framework core.
